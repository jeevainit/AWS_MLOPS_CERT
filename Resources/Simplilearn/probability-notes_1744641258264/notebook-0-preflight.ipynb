    "\n",
    "Each notebook is designed to be completed in about 30-60 minutes. Here's how to get the most out of them:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Read the explanations** carefully—they build intuition before introducing formulas\n",
    "2. **Run the code cells** to see concepts in action\n",
    "3. **Experiment with the code**—change parameters to see what happens!\n",
    "4. **Complete the exercises** to test your understanding\n",
    "5. **Take breaks** between sections to let concepts sink in\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Path\n",
    "\n",
    "We've structured this course into five notebooks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Probability Foundations**: Basic concepts, experiments, and events\n",
    "2. **Random Variables and Distributions**: Discrete and continuous distributions\n",
    "3. **Conditional Probability and Bayes' Theorem**: Updating beliefs with evidence\n",
    "4. **Connecting Probability to Machine Learning**: Using probability in classification\n",
    "5. **Advanced Topics** (Optional): For those who want to go deeper\n",
